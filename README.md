# writeups
A few months ago, at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology, six friends decided it was time to boost their productivity into a higher gear. They were very passionate about various subjects like reinforcement learning, data science, sports, game theory, and neuroscience. As they gathered one fine day in a nice cafe, each member shared their enthusiasm for diving deep into research and innovation.
Anirudh initiated a conversation. "We're always buzzing with ideas, exploring intriguing topics that fascinate us. What if we could combine all this passion into something extraordinary? something that would make us stand out?"
The idea immediately resonated with the group. The idea then becomes abstract: "Why don't we form a research group?"
As the group exchanged excited glances, Avanthikaa, known for their eloquence, shared their thoughts. "We can be the storytellers", the content creators who bridge the gap between complex concepts and the layman. "Let's make these overrated topics come alive through literature."
Pranav, with his sports-desired spirit, chimed in. "I've always been curious about how AI can revolutionize sports. Let's make that part of our research and bring innovation into the sports industry." 
Finally, Preetha, the psychology enthusiast, spoke up. "I'd like to delve into the realm of cognitive psychology, understand how our minds work, and contribute valuable insights. Together, we can cover a wide spectrum of topics." 
And so, the group's vision began to take shape. Anirudh, who had a knack for implementation "The fun part of any research is INFERENCEEEE!!", he said. Assured them he'd lead the technical side and handle the practical aspects of their projects.
And hence, "WRITEUPS" was formed.
